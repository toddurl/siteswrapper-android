 *
 * Google Cloud Messaging for Android (GCM) is a service that allows you to send data from your server to your users Android-powered device.
 * This could be a lightweight message telling your app there is new data to be fetched from the server (for instance, a movie uploaded by a
 * friend), or it could be a message containing up to 4kb of payload data (so apps like instant messaging can consume the message directly).
 * 
 * The GCM service handles all aspects of queueing of messages and delivery to the target Android application running on the target device.
 * GCM is completely free no matter how big your messaging needs are, and there are no quotas.
